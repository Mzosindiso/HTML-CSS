# JavaScript
We place JavaScript at the bottom of the page because, the browser reads the code in the order it appears in the file. <br>
If the script loads 1<sup>st</sup> and it is supposed to affect the HTML that has not loaded yet, there could be some issues. Placing JavaScript near the bottom of an HTML page is one way to accommodate this dependency.<br>
<strong>Variable</strong> - container that holds the data values, (stores/update/manipulate information).<br>
Javascript is <i><strong>case sensitive</i></strong>, <em>myVariable</em> is not the same as <em>myvariable</em>. <br>
To declare a variable: <b>var, let, const</b>.
