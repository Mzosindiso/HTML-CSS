# React
<p>React is a popular library used to create user interfaces. React components use Pascal case (or upper camel case) variable names</p>
<p>Component: is an independent, reusable code block which divides the UI into smaller pieces.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Function component - is basically a JavaScript/ES6 function that returns a React element (JSX)</li>
    ```bash
    <script>
        function Welcome(props) {
              return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
        }
    </script>
    ```
    <li>Class-based component - </li>
    <li>Presentational component - </li>
    <li>Container components - </li>
</ul>
<p>JSX is a combination of JavaScript and the X from XML. It is a JavaScript extension that allows us to define React elements using a tag-based syntax directly within our JavaScript code.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Props - are used to pass data from component to component</li>
    <li>State - it's what makes your application grow beyond static content being displayed on a website, because a user can interact with it</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Props are used to pass information down the component tree, state is used to alter information over time.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
