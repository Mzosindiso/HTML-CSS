<p>Component: Components allow us to reuse the same DOM structure for different recipes or different sets of data.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Function component - </li>
    <li>Class-based component - </li>
    <li>Presentational component - </li>
    <li>Container components - </li>
</ul>
<p>JSX is a combination of JavaScript and the X from XML. It is a JavaScript extension that allows us to define React elements using a tag-based syntax directly within our JavaScript code.</p>
